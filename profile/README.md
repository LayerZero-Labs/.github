# Welcome to LayerZero

<br></br>
[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is an innovative open-source, immutable messaging protocol, that connects blockchains (50+ and counting) to enable omnichain interoperability for blockchain applications. With LayerZero, developers have the power to create applications that can seamlessly interact across multiple blockchains.
​<br></br>
Refer to the [LayerZero V2 Docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/overview) for implementing, handling, and debugging LayerZero contracts.

​
## Build on LayerZero V2
​
Developers can easily send arbitrary data, external function calls, and tokens with omnichain messaging while preserving full autonomy and control over their application:
​
- **OApp**: a generic message passing interface to send and receive arbitrary pieces of data across different blockchains. See the[ OApp Quickstart](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview) to start building.
​<br></br>
- **OFT**: enables fungible tokens to be transferred across multiple blockchains without asset wrapping or middlechains. See the [OFT Quickstart](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart) to learn more.
​
## Build on LayerZero V1
​
For legacy support for LayerZero V1, refer to the [Endpoint V1 documentation](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1).
​
## Run DVNs and Executors
​
See reference implementations for how the [DVN](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/technical-reference/dvn-addresses) and [Executor](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/permissionless-execution/executors) communicate with the Ultra Light Nodes on each chain.
​
- **DVN**: Developers can run a custom DVN by deploying a DVN contract on every chain they want to support. See the [Build DVN](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/off-chain/build-dvns) guide to create your own security providers.
​​<br></br>
- **Executor**: Developers can deploy a custom Executor to ensure the seamless execution of messages on the destination chain. See the [Executor](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/off-chain/build-executors) guide.
